# AWS s3api WATCH OLD CLI VERSION!!!

[Old reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/)
[New](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/list-objects-v2.html)

## 403 Error:



```sh
# To get AWS Canonical ID
aws s3api list-buckets --query Owner.ID

# for the Amazon S3 canonical ID of the account that owns the object that users can't access
aws s3api list-objects --bucket awsexamplebucket --prefix exampleprefix 
# list-objects-v2 is a paginated operation. See docs.
aws s3api list-objects-v2
```

### --prefix 

Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

## [Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html)

Requests made to Amazon S3 through an access point appear in your S3 server access logs and AWS CloudTrail logs with the access point's hostname. An access point's hostname takes the form access_point_name-account_id.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com.

There is a description on this functionality at the above link. My issue is that I do not believe I have this functionality in place with my portfolio. However, to make a point to reference the troubleticket response about --prefeixes not returning values I need to understand what this means.

For example, suppose that you have the following bucket and access point configuration:

* A bucket named my-bucket in Region us-west-2 that contains object my-image.jpg
* An access point named my-bucket-ap that is associated with my-bucket
* Your AWS account ID is 123456789012
* A request made to retrieve my-image.jpg directly through the bucket appears in your logs with a hostname of my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com. If you make the request through the access point instead, Amazon S3 retrieves the same object but logs the request with a hostname of my-bucket-ap-123456789012.s3-accesspoint.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

## Request an Object Through an Access Point

```sh
aws s3api get-object --key my-image.jpg --bucket arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/prod download.jpg
```
