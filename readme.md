# AWS-2020

As we build Kubernetes on AWS I am needing to bring my skills current on AWS Serives to maximize efficiency. As the runguide and playbook rules are generated, we will be moving AWS training to this repo, and in parallel bring all needed documentation for our use case into the appropriate cluster and project documentation publishing workflows.
