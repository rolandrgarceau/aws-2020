## Replicate issue

Capture the complete request and response using a tool of your choice. I was using Chrome for a while and I believe an update crashed my Canary Install. 

[Using Postman to capture requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/capturing-http-requests/). Similar to the Interceptor Chrome extension, the Postman app proxy also INTERCEPTS and captures your requests.

It looks like Postman may be tightly knitted with the developer console today. [Intercepter and Chrome](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/interceptor/#using-the-interceptor-with-postmans-chrome-app).

### Todo - Revisit [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/capturing-http-requests/)

They have a built-in proxy in the Postman native apps or use the Interceptor extension for the Postman app. The docs on intercepter [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/interceptor/), enables people to sync cookies from the browser to Postman and capture network requests directly from Chrome.

If HSTS is enabled for a website, then HTTPS will not work. I think I was using this tool some months back testing Java. Kendall used it at Duke with Spring I believe.
